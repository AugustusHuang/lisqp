TODO LIST
=========

1. Implement an opcode frame pointer in order to make it easy to tell which
opcodes are consecutive, are related or interested.
2. I/O interface of opcodes.
3. There's something wrong in APPLY-2-GATE and COLLAPSE, fix them.
4. Quantum library level arithmetic functions.
5. Support more data structures besides integers, floats and ratios.
